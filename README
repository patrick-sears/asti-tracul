prs-asti-tracul:
It takes asti-traspe data for several videos in one device or
culture and does further analysis.

glob_vu_mag
  - The mean of all sys2_vu_val
  - The sys2_vu_val is the component of the
    fov's mean velocity unit vector in the sys2
    flow direction, which could be negative.
  - Range:  [-1, 1], 1 = exactly in standard
    flow direction.
glob_vu_dir
  - The global direction of flow as determined
    by the unit vector.
  - Values:  +1 or -1.
      +1:  It's a 2pi.u+ culture.
      -1:  It's a 2pi.u- culture.
glob_v_val
  - The mean from all FOVs of the component of the
    FOV's mean velocity along the sys2 e1 vector.
    This is the mean speed globally going around
    the culture.
Note that glob_vu_mag and glob_v_val could have different
signs.  For example...  Imagine there are three very slow
2pi.u+ FOVs and one very fast 2pi.u- FOV.  Then glob_vu_mag > 0
because it is dominated by the direction in each FOV.  But
glob_v_val < 0 because it is an average of the speeds and,
in this case, the mean speed is dominated by the one single
FOV with a high speed.
